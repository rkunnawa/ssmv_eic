School of Science and Math summer workshop for metro Nashville high school students - 2023 
"Lets Smash the Proton"

https://www.vanderbilt.edu/cseo-ssmv/

This is a 4-day summer workshop at the level of high school students on the topic of the EIC. Each day includes a 30-40 minute lecture followed by a 1.5 hr hands on session where students can run python jupyter notebook via binder on their browser. The only material the students would need is a computer with an interner browser. The goal of this workshop is to introduce the exciting area of research related to the EIC and to study fundamental particles leading to finding answers to the question of "What makes up a proton?". 

If you want to run the code yourself, click the binder link above and go through the different days. 

the lectures are all available on this github repo as well - 
Day 1: Simulating collisions of electrons and protons at various energies indicate the composite nature of the proton 
Day 2 : Momentum is conserved before and after the collision taking into account all the particles produced
Day 3 : The number of particles produced from the break-up of the proton depends on the energy of the collision - more energy leads to more particles 
Day 4 : Detecting the electron via its deflection is crucial to understand the energy at which we probe the proton and thus to learn whats inside it 

This software is available free to everyone to promote EIC science to high school students. Please feel free to ask any questions or report bugs, suggestions, improements to "raghav.ke@vanderbilt.edu" 
thanks! and happy science communication!
